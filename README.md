# Implementing-Chatterbot-Module-For-A-ChatBot-In-Python
About ChatterBot

ChatterBot is a Python library that makes it easy to generate automated responses to a user’s input. ChatterBot uses a selection of machine learning algorithms to produce different types of responses. This makes it easy for developers to create chat bots and automate conversations with users. For more details about the ideas and concepts behind ChatterBot see the process flow diagram.

An example of typical input would be something like this:

user: Good morning! How are you doing?
bot:  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.
user: You're welcome.
bot:  Do you like hats?

Language Independence

The language independent design of ChatterBot allows it to be trained to speak any language. Additionally, the machine-learning nature of ChatterBot allows an agent instance to improve it’s own knowledge of possible responses as it interacts with humans and other sources of informative data.
